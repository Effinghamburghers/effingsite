The ACO for Effingham (and Albany and Ossipee) displays an appalling lack of knowledge about both working dogs and the ["law"](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/xlv/466/466-31.htm) protecting these dogs from official mischief. Perhaps an opportunity for improved training??

Recently, a [bill](http://gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/bill_docket.aspx?lsr=2087&sy=2020&txtsessionyear=2020&txtbillnumber=HB1389&sortoption=&q=1) before the New Hampshire General Court was just unanimously voted out of committee "Inexpedient to Legislate". The report [stated on bottom of page 6](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/caljourns/calendars/2020/HC_7.pdf)


>This bill sought to impose additional standards for shelter and allowed outside exposure for dogs. There was overwhelming testimony outlining the issues that the requirements would impose on several cold weather breeds, state police dogs, and **working farm dogs.**  The committee feels that the existing laws are sufficient and encourages improved **law enforcement training** in administering our current statute.
