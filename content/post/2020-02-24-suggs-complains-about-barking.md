Neighbor comes to Board of Selectmen on October 4, 2016 to complain about the barking dogs, but acknowledges that Livestock Guardian Dogs are exempt from the ["barking law"](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/xlv/466/466-31.htm)  

They scheme to find a way to get rid of the dogs by going around the statute, and Selectman Henry Spencer, even after hearing the statute's description, encourages the neighbors to "tape record from their mailbox" and get letters of complaints to the board so they can use mob rule to subvert our [Right to Farm](http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/I/21/21-34-a.htm)
