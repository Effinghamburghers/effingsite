Chief Timothy Butts comes to Board of Selectmen on December 6, 2016 with a new idea on how to get rid of barking dogs. Chief admits that NH AG and County Attorney has verified that they can't charge me for barking because my dogs are bona fide LGD under the law.

They scheme to find a way to get rid of the dogs by suggesting that perhaps there is a cruelty to animals angle they can pursue criminally, and contacted the NH State Veterinarian and SPCA about an abuse charges and animal welfare, and how they are looking for a charge that will stick in District Court.

King Henry Spencer alludes to illicit non-public meetings to discuss my dogs.

They also discuss helping neighbors pursue civil action against me.
