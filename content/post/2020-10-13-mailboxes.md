Late winter in rural New Hampshire has its charms, but mud season and ennui follow. While Winter spits out her last of ice and snow, Spring peers around the corner with hints of mud and buds. Here in Effingham our contract plow trucks make sport by slip sliding on icy mud and take out mailboxes. It's just the way of things.

The current crop of outlander Selectmen were baffled by the angst of Effinghamburghers whose mail was dispossessed due to Town Contractor error. It seems that their piecemeal approach to this issue was first to deny, then to pass a ["Right of Way Ordinance"](http://www.effinghamnh.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/row-ordinance-2019.signed.reformatted.pdf) so they wouldn't be bothered by angry peasants whose checks had gone astray when their mailbox was splintered, strewn or otherwise left unfillable. 

The Selectmen assigned themselves the arbiters of what the road right of way is for any stretch of road. This author was in the sudden position of having her mailbox remain permanently on the neighbors lawn rather than in the Official Post Office Deliverable Location, and, encouraged by the thoughfulness of the Board of Selectmen, endeavored to ascertain the right-of-way for her across-the-street abutters property.

When two Vogon worlds collide, the Vogons survive and little creatures are crushed in the impact. In this case, the Vogon Postal Code For Placement of Rural Mailboxes and the Effinghamburghers of the Board of Selectmen nearly succeeded in crushing this author. The Postal Vogons *insist* that the mailbox be on the right hand side of the road as the carrier travels east, and that means across the street from my property. The Select Board Vogons have Regulations About The Placement of Boxes In The Their I Mean The Town's Right Of Way. Yes, dear reader, my head nearly exploded to.

So, after realizing that I was on of the peasants with an astray check at the Beginning of The Damn Panic About COVID-19, I crept out of my winter lair and attended the 25 March 2020 meeting of the Effingham Board of Selectmen.

Oh, the Horror. A peasant dared stray into the Town Office and attempt to petition the government for redress of greivances. I sat through over an hour of whining and droning and blather until the part of The Agenda where peasants are allowed to speak, when I was told there would be No New Business.
